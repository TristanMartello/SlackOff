Main routine is followed unless Suspicion is triggered:
  Boss main routine events:
    works at desk idly (is normally aware)
    walks a path to check on employees (highly aware, may check on player)
    takes heated confrence call (low awareness)
    goes to bathroom (high awareness while going to/from, no awareness during)
    
 When suspicion is triggered:
  Boss has two suspicion metrics general and individual
    When low ammounts of work is done in general around the office, general suspicion rises 
      May lead to increased frequency of employee checkins
        This gets too high, maybe a team bonding mini game is triggered?
      Catching a non player slacker lowers general suspicion (maybe it makes other employees hate the player more though if player throws them under the bus?)
    When individual reports are lacking or the boss sees the player do something suspicious individual suspicion rises
      individual suspicion leads to boss spending more time surveiling player, (could lead to firing)
